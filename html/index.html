            There is currently no simple, centralized, and customizable way for music listeners to keep track of and gain more insight into the music that they listen to. 
            The average person spends 20 hours listening to music each week. 
            These sorts of listening hours can mean that listeners may be engaging with hundreds or thousands of songs over the course of a few months without any customizable means of keeping track of their listening habits. 
            Streaming services provide ways to organize music into playlists and play them but MelodyHarbor wants to add a more analytical method of organization. 
            Users will be able to search for songs categorized by different genres, music theory concepts, and lyrics. 
            Some unique features include key signatures, instruments, vocal ranges, and chord progressions which allow musicians to have a more selective search based on their interests. 
            MelodyHarbor will also group songs into albums and record information on several record labels and artists.
